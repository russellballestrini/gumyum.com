Hey there! 

<br><br>

We have started a co-operative video game studio called gumyum.

<br><br>

The basic idea is to build a video game company owned completely by members. There will be no employees and most revenue after paying taxes, operational expenses, and marketing, will be divided among members.

<br><br>

We already have a distributed team of 4 artists and 2 engineers who meet on Slack as we progress toward delivering our first two games:

<br><br>

<ul>
<li>Trouble Shooters</li>
<li>Lucha De Pinata (Pinata Fight)</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

We are actively looking for both <a href="https://www.patreon.com/gumyum">Patreons</a> as well as self motivated <a href="/contact-us">co-op members</a> to build games with us.

<br><br>

If you are an engineer who builds games, or wants to build games, reach out!
